    Version 0.9 Beta:
        Still only works in Win OS, (I know I'm sorry. Didn't have time to update. I will get back to this asap)
        
        Please use killstyle by calling "python3 run.py" in terminal
        
        Initial return from stylechecker will be stored to res.tmp, changes will be made directly to JAVA_SOURCE_FILE.java
        
        IMPORTANT: use killstyle REPEATEDLY until res.tmp stops changing to get final output

        Pending imporvement for 1.0 Beta:
            1. fix "run", use python function only to support all OS
            2. improve run, stores every res.tmp to a list and repeatedly call itself until new res.tmp "res in list is True"
            3. add more styling rules to "fix"

    Version 0.9 Alpha:
        Only works in Win OS, pending improvement to "run" function to support more OS.
        
        Please use killsytle by calling "python3 killstyle.py JAVA_SOURCE_FILE.
        java" in terminal
        
        Initial evaluation will be stored to res.tmp, changes will be made directly to JAVA_SOURCE_FILE.java
        
        IMPORTANT: use killstyle REPEATEDLY until res.tmp stops changing to get final output
